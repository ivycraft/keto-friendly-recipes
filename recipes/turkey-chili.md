prep time: 20 min, cook time: 2 hr. 20 min., total time: 2 hr. 40 min.

INGREDIENTS:
 * 2 tbsp. vegitable or corn oil
 * 2 medium onions, chopped fine
 * 1 medium red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into half-inch squares
 * 6 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press
 * 1/4 cup chili powder
 * 1 tbsp. ground cumin
 * 2 tsp. ground coriander
 * 1 tsp. red pepper flakes
 * 1 tsp. ground oregano
 * 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
 * 2 lb. ground turkey (half dark, half light)
 * 2 (15 oz.) cans dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
 * 1 (28 oz.) can diced tomatoes
 * 1 (28 oz.) can tomato puree
 * salt
 * 2 limes cut into wedges
 
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 1. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, oregano, and cayenne and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegitables are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and add half of the turkey. Cook, breaking up the chunks with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes.
 2. Add the beans, tomato puree, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, and stirring occasionally for 1 hr. Remove the cover and continue to simmer 1 hour longer, stirring occasionally (if the chili begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, stir in 1/2 cup water and continue to simmer), until the turkey is tender and the chili is dark, rich, and slightly thickened. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Serve with the lime wedges and condiments (cheese, avacado, green onion, sour cream) if desired.
